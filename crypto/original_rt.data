Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.t is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).As described by Homer in the Iliad[6] at the advice of Hectorâ€™s brother Helenus (who also was divinely inspired) and being told by him that he was not destined to die yet, Hector managed to get both armies seated and challenged any one of the Greek warriors to single combat. The Argives were initially reluctant to accept the challenge. However, after Nestor's chiding, nine Greek heroes stepped up to the challenge and drew by lot to see who was to face Hector. Ajax won and fought Hector. Hector was unable to pierce Ajax's famous shield, but Ajax crushed Hector's shield with a rock and stabbed through his armor with a spear, drawing blood, upon which the god Apollo intervened and the duel was ended as the sun was setting. Hector gave Ajax his sword, which Ajax later used to kill himself. Ajax gave Hector his girdle that Achilles later attached to his chariot to drag Hector's corpse around the walls of Troy.South Africa are not in a good way. They've recently lost Dale Steyn and Hashim Amla, two of their greatest players ever. They had such a poor World Cup campaign last year they didn't even get the chance to pull off a high-comedy choke. Their board was in turmoil as well. It was sad to see them struggle on so many fronts, many felt. The sport can't afford for South Africa to dip so drastically, the cricket world agreed. Then England showed up, and like bullies picking on the weakest kid in school, kicked South Africa in the groin in Cape Town, stole their lunch money in Port Elizabeth, and rubbed their faces in the dirt in Johannesburg. On top of which Jos Buttler called Vernon Philander a fatty in Philander's last series everIs Pakistan safe? This is a question the Bangladesh Cricket Board pondered for months. Or at least this is the question they said they were pondering. There was nothing they didn't supposedly consider - whether limited-overs games are a safer option than Tests, whether the team should be flown back to Dhaka in between matches, whether rising tensions between the US and Iran would make it more risky, and probably whether this kind of sports engagement is even appropriate following the planet-shaking revelations that Meghan and Harry will be stepping away from royal duties. Then, after weeks of insisting they just wanted a simple in-and-out T20I tour for security reasons, the BCB's president met with the PCB's head honcho and confirmed that they would be coming not just once, for T20Is, but coming back for a first Test, and then a third time for a second Test, in the most convoluted touring schedule in recent memory.ow many hearts can one team win until that team gets sick of winning just hearts? On Wednesday, New Zealand were on the wrong side of a Super Over result for the third time in eight months, having of course cruelly lost the World Cup in similar fashion, before being beaten by England in a Super Over again last year. As the undisputed nicest fellows in the world they are generating industrial amounts of good karma, but clearly this karma is being misplaced. Somewhere in the world a monster who never indicates in traffic keeps winning lottery.Angelo Mathews knew that former coach Chandika Hathurusingha wanted him to lose weight. In fact, back in October 2018, Hathurusingha even suggested publicly that Mathews needed to work on his fitness, after he was part of the decision to sack Mathews as captain and drop him from the ODI team. Mathews, though, was publicly defiant of Hathurusingha, and never quite lost all the weight.Then, last month, just as SLC finally got around to terminating Hathurusingha's contract as head coach, Mathews turned up for the T20Is against India rocking a flat stomach and exactly the slim physique Hathurusingha had wanted Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.In the last week of January, Kevin Pietersen launched a two-part Twitter tirade at the "cry babies" criticising Boris Johnson and Donald Trump, suggesting that their detractors should "keep it zipped" because these men are in positions of authority. Wait till he hears about the guy who seriously undermined the captaincy of Andrew Strauss that one time.The only highlight of the final session on the fifth day was Mendis' century, which he brought up in style - a sumptuous six off Raza, skipping down the track and launching him comfortably over long-on. Mendis ended with an unbeaten 116, five runs short of 3000 Test runs.he final day had started with Williams declaring Zimbabwe's second innings on 247 for 7 after just one ball: an uncharacteristic leg-stump half-volley by Suranga Lakmal that Sean Williams flicked over deep square leg for sixThe shot brought up Williams' third Test fifty, but more importantly, Zimbabwe got the chance to use the heavy roller on a dry Harare deck at the start of the day. The idea presumably being to widen some of the cracks on the pitch, and give their bowlers a better chance of bowling out a team in the fourth innings of a Test for just the seventh time in their history.And the plan seemed to have worked too, where following a period of tight bowling, Carl Mumba coaxed Dimuth Karunaratne into a false stroke outside off. The batsman tried to pull out at the last moment but not before the ball took the outside edge and went into the wicketkeeper's gloves.The period following the wicket was one of Zimbabwe's most threatening, with both Oshada Fernando and Mendis looking uncomfortable against a buoyant home attack. However, in the 24th over Mendis looked to shift gears, picking off Victor Nyauchi for back to back boundaries through midwicket. Fernando joined the party in the next over, taking Williams for three fours - two lofted over mid-on, the third drilled through the covers.While Nyauchi did constantly test the pair during this period, beating the outside edge on a few occasions and inducing it at other times - twice resulting in boundaries down to third man, with another bouncing just in front of first slip - the pair nevertheless made it through to lunch unscathed.Zimbabwe were, however, given a brief glimmer of hope when Fernando was trapped lbw by Raza in the second over after lunch, and then later when Angelo Mathews was dismissed towards the end of the session - owing to some innovative field settings, that saw short extra-cover, short cover, short mid-off, short mid-on and short midwicket in place at one point - but Mendis, aided by an obdurate Dinesh Chandimal ensured there was no further damage with the teams shaking hands 15 minutes into the final hour.The post-lunch session though was a dour affair, yielding just 51 runs for Sri Lanka and a further two wickets for Zimbabwe - effectively ending any lingering hopes of a result.Even as they pushed for a first ever Test win against Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe's cricketers did so knowing their salaries would be cut after the two-Test series. Zimbabwe had been defeated in the first Test by 10 wickets, though they fought well in the first half of the match.Zimbabwe Cricket chairman TavenLast year, the ICC had banned all Zimbabwe teams from participating in any international competitions citing government interference in running the national board. During the ban period, the ICC had also stopped all funds to Zimbabwe Cricket. The government had fired the board amid allegations of corruption and financial mismanagement, sparking the ban. The cricket board was later reinstated and the ICC lifted its ban in October 2019.Zimbabwe were allotted a grant of USD 94 million from the ICC for an eight-year period from 2017. But Mukuhlani, who is part of the ICC board as a representative of a Test-playing nation, said there has been reduced financial help from the ICC in other areas for many countries and that's exacerbated the problems in Zimbabwe.Tamim makes a comeback to the Test side after last playing in the format in March 2019 against New Zealand. Shanto last played a Test in September 2018 and Soumya, who missed out on the India series last year, last played in the home Test against Afghanistan in November. Rubel fell out of favour in Test cricket after some poor performances in 2017-18 but he's been recalled in place of the recovering Taskin Ahmed.While Imrul is still recovering from a hamstring injury, Mosaddek has been out of action since the middle of the India tour due to a shoulder injury. Mushfiqur is also suffering from a hamstring injury and could also be ruled out of the one-off Test against Zimbabwe later this month, while offspinner Mehidy is yet to recover from a finger injury.Ghafari's six-wicket haul, on the opening day of the World Cup, against hosts South Africa, lit the tournament up.Noor, only 15, has made other countries jealous of Afghanistan's plethora of spin-bowling options. As Afghanistan continue to find leaders for the future, in Zakhil they found a man with a clear thought process.Heavy rain in Adelaide had provoked doubt over whether the match would begin on time or even be completed at all, but the skies cleared and the ground drained with more than enough time to spare. The weather left in its wake a fresher pitch than usual for an Adelaide Oval T20 match, convincing the Strikers captain Travis Head to send the Thunder in, having batted fist whenever possible in earlier home matches.The strategy for the Strikers, then, would have appeared obvious, in terms of bowling a little fuller than usual to seek movement and outside edges. However, Stanlake and Agar appeared not to have got the memo, dropping down obligingly short for Usman Khawaja briefly and then Alex Hales at length to use their power off the back foot. Siddle and Michael Neser were far more intelligent in their approaches, often beating the bat whenever they bowled a driveable length, meaning the Thunder scorecard soon developed a lopsided appearance.So while Hales scored freely, others struggled, though Ferguson was very unfortunate to be fired out lbw to Siddle by the umpire Paul Wilson - the ball looked to be comfortably clearing the stumps as the batsman tried to pull it. Hales' innings was ended when he misread a Rashid Khan leg break as a wrong'un and edged it tamely to point, and the sight of Arjun Nair walking out to bat at No. 5 did not say much for the Thunder's batting depth.Consequently, the innings gradually decelerated, as 2 for 89 after 11 overs deteriorated to 7 for 151 after 20. While Stanlake and Agar went for 75 between them from seven overs the e other Strikers bowlers cost just 76 from the remaining 13, and only Morris could pass 20 from among the Thunder's middle-order players.There was some excellent bowling upfront by the Thunder to give themselves a chance of defending their mediocre tally. Sams flummoxed Phil Salt with a slower ball to draw a catch to mid-on, Jake Weatherald was hurried out by an excellent bouncer from Chris Tremain, and Head, after looking composed and proactive, contrived to drag Cook's wrist spin onto the stumps to have the Strikers uncertainly placed at 3 for 65 in the 10th over.But the depth of the Strikers' batting line-up was underlined by the fact they had Jon Wells - the leading middle-order batsman in the tournament - coming in at No. 5 whereas the Thunder had needed to send in Nair. What followed was a 50-run stand in 35 balls between Wells and Alex Carey, as the target was quickly whittled down through deft placement and strategically timed boundaries. It was a surprise, in fact, when Carey was run out by a direct hit from Ferguson, leaving Wells with the primary responsibility.He could only watch at the non-striker's end as Rashid slogged Cook into the outfield to leave him with another fine set of figures, and Matt Short was then pinned lbw by a Morris delivery that was swift and straight. Wells and Neser then allowed the equation to drift out to 34 required from the final three overs, before they sized up Tremain. Neser's obvious intention to walk towards the off side had Tremain bowling wide, and four times in the 18th over he pitched on our outside the tram lines to hand the Strikers a run
